I'm up on the eleventh floor
And I'm watching the cruisers below
He's down on the street
And he's trying hard
to pull sister Flo
My heart's in the basement
My weekend's at an all time low

'Cause she's hoping to score
So I can't see her
letting him go
Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind

[CHORUS]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat
and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it,
she don't make false claims
But she's a Queen,
and such are queens
That your laughter
is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say,
why didn't I say, no, no, no

[CHORUS]

So I lay down a while
And I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
But he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all

It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say,
Why didn't I say, no, no, no

People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace

The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace

[CHORUS]
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight 
([second time:] really quite paradise)
And he sang all night long

Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey

Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay

[CHORUS]

Oh how I sighed 
When they asked if I knew his name

[CHORUS]

Get some pussy now!

Didn't know what time it was and the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll 'lotta soul, 
he said

Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no D.J. that was hazy cosmic jive

[CHORUS]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me:
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!
Switch on the TV 
we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window I can see his light

If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

President Joe once had a dream
The world held his hand, gave their pledge

So he told them his scheme for a Saviour Machine

They called it the Prayer, its answer was law
Its logic stopped war, gave them food
How they adored till it cried in its boredom

'Please don't believe in me, please disagree with me

Life is too easy, a plague seems quite feasible now
or maybe a war, or I may kill you all

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away

Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine

I need you flying, and I'll show that dying

Is living beyond reason, sacred dimension of time
I perceive every sign, I can steal every mind

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away

Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine

When I live my dream, I'll take you with me
Riding on a golden horse
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you

Happy at the sound of your voice

Baby, I'll slay a dragon for you
Or banish wicked giants from the land
But you will find, that nothing in my dream can hurt you
We will only love each other as forever

When I live my dream
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me 

And the empty man you left behind
It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me 
Only love can live in my dream
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish 

Wish, and the storm will fade away
Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an ouverture 
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream

When I live my dream, please be there to meet me

Let me be the one to understand
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave 
Then we can live in our new land
Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm going to make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream

"6","Join The Gang","David Bowie","1967","http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/jointhegang.html","

Let me introduce you to the gang
Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist
Once he had a name, now he plays our game
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang
Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong 
Cause she can't switch off, now that she's joined the gang
Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the band 
You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
It's a big illusion but at least you're in
At least you're in
This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff
15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke 
This is how to spend now that you've joined a gang 
This is what to do now that you're here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang

"7","God Knows I\'m Good","Space Oddity","1969","http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/godknowsimgood.html","

I was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder

And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind

Crying
""God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today

God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today""

Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly 
for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling 
wooden floor

Crying
""God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look
the other way

God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look

"9","She\'s Got Medals","David Bowie","1967","http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/shesgotmedals.html","

She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks 
on the house
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped 
her back 
And never took her out
She wore a trenchcoat khaki
Her hobnail boots were full of holes
She's got medals
Her mother called her Mary, she changed her name to Tommy,
she's a one, oh 
She went and joined the army, passed the medical
Don't ask me how it's done
They sent her to the front line
Fighting for her country's name
She's got medals
She got very tired of picking up girls
Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls
Then the enemy dropped a bomb
Survivors there were none
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed
You can see her ghost but that's a lie because the naughty woman isn't dead
She deserted on the previous morning
Replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green
Called herself Eileen
Came to London town
Now she's settled down
She's got medals

There's a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz
Til the war come along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot

And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand

He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home
""Ah-choo, excuse me""
Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care 
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair

And you put it in your pocket
""God, it's pouring down""
Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket
Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only 10 and full of life and oh so gay

And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, oh God
No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
I've started digging holes myself
And this one here's for you
""Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
Hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
Bloody obscene, catch pneumonia or something in this rain""

"11","Five Years","The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars","1972","http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/fiveyears.html","

Pushing thru the market 
square
so many mothers sighing
News had just come over, 
we had five years left to cry in

News guy wept and told us 
earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet
then I knew he was not lying

I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys electric irons and T.V.'s
My brain hurt like a warehouse
it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things 
to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head
hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them

A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheel of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
and a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
don't think you knew you were in this song

And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
We've got five years, that's all we've got

Won't someone invite them 
They're just taller children, that's all, after all 

Man is an obstacle, sad as the clown, Oh by jingo 
So hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down, Oh by jingo 
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone 
Others are running, the smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence, they're just older children 
That's all, after all 

I sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords, with my words 
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called 
But the thought just occurred that we're nobody's children At all, after all 
Live till your rebirth and do what you will, Oh by jingo 
Forget all I've said, please bear me no ill, Oh by jingo

And the stars look very different today

For here
Am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past 
one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much

It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling ""No""
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks
through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it
ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on Amerika's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse
has grown up a cow
Now the workers 
have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it

It's about to be writ again

To mansions cold and grey

While the sane stay underground

They tell me I can blow 
To the far side of town 
Where it's pointless to be high 
'Cause it's such a long way down

I can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm 

I will do me harm 
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall

Don't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be 
Just my librium and me 
And my E.S.T. makes three 

'Cause I'd rather stay here 
With all the madmen 
Than perish with the sadmen roaming free 

And I'd rather play here 
With all the madmen 
For I'm quite content they're all as sane as me 

(Where can the horizon lie 
When a nation hides 
Its organic minds in a cellar...dark and grim
They must be very dim) 

Day after day 
They take some brain away 
Then turn my face around 
To the far side of town 
And tell me that it's real 
Then ask me how I feel 

Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall 
I'm not quite right at all 
Don't set me free, I'm as helpless as can be 
My libido's split on me 
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy

Roaming free And I'd rather play here

The Children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

Touch, We touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love
upon a white balloon
And fly it from 
the topest top of all the tops 
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something 
just the same

We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through 
the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And We walked back to the road, unchained

Drawing to the ragged hole

Oh, hear this Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man 
called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
His words of truthful vengeance
They could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more

Ah, Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

You gave your heart to every bedsit room
At least a picture on my wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
The paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising
We'd rather be scared
Together than alone

Ah, Here she comes...[etc.]

Now hear this Robert Zimmerman
Though I don't suppose we'll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he'd gaze a while
down the old street
Tell him we've lost his poems
So they're writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
Give us back our family
You're every nation's refugee
Don't leave us with their sanity

Ah, Here she comes....[etc.]

Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
Here came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders while the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us.
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass,
He was the naz
With God given ass
He took it all too far
But boy could he play guitar.

Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

"24","Running Gun Blues","The Man Who Sold The World","1970","http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/runninggunblues.html","

I count the corpses on my left, I find I'm not so tidy
So I better get away, better make it today
I've cut twenty-three down since Friday
But I can't control it, my face is drawn
My instinct still emotes it

I slash them cold, I kill them dead
I broke the gooks, I cracked their heads
I'll bomb them out from under the beds
But now I've got the running gun blues

It seems the peacefuls stopped the war
Left generals squashed and stifled
But I'll slip out again tonight
Cause they haven't taken back my rifle
For I promote oblivion
And I'll plug a few civilians

I'll slash them cold, I'll kill them dead
I'll break them gooks, I'll crack their heads
I'll slice them till they're running red
But now I've got the running gun blues

"25","Width Of A Circle","The Man Who Sold The World","1970","http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/widthofacircle.html","

In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree.

And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked ""Why not?"" and I replied ""I don't know""
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be

And he laughed insane and quipped ""KAHLIL GIBRAN""
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

So I said ""So long"" and I waved ""Bye-bye""
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind

Got laid by a young bordello
I was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag

And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said ""You'll never go down to the Gods again""
(Turn around,go back!)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said ""Do it again, do it again""
(Turn around,go back!)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said ""Do it again, do it again""
(Turn around, go back!)

Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply

And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed

Waiting for you

"26","An Occasional Dream","Space Oddity","1969","http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/anoccasionaldream.html","

I recall how we lived
On the corner of a bed
And we'd speak of a Swedish room
Of hessian and wood
And we'd talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise...
Some things we could do

In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An Occasional Dream

And we'd sleep, oh so close
But not really close our eyes
'Tween the sheets of summer 
bathed in blue...
Gently weeping nights
It was long, long ago
And I can't touch your name

For the days of fate 
were strong for you...
Danced you far from me

In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An Occasional Dream
Of mine
An Occasional Dream
Of mine
An Occasional Dream
Of mine

Just look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you'll walk through your door I'll wave my flag and shout

Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday
Da da da dum [x4]

Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch

Don't be afraid it's only me, hoping for a little romance

If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool

Oh, beatiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday
Da da da dum [x7]
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me

I shall always watch you until my love runs dry

Oh, beautiful baby
My heart's a flame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday

Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday [x2]
Da da da dum [x11]

Well, I might stretch it till Wednesday

"28","She Shook Me Cold","The Man Who Sold The World","1970","http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/sheshookmecold.html","

We met upon a hill, the night was cool and still
She sucked my dormant will
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again
My God, she shook me cold

I had no time to spare, I grabbed her golden hair
And threw her to the ground
Father, she craved my head, Oh Lord, the things she said
My God, she should be told

I was very smart, broke the gentle hearts
Of many young virgins

I was quick on the ball, left them so lonely
They'd just give up trying

Then she took my head, smashed it up
Kept my young blood rising
Crushed me mercilessly, kept me going around

So she didn't know I crave her so-o-o

I'll give my love in vain, to reach that peak again
We met upon a hill
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again
My God, she shook me cold

Oh my love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wanderer
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand

Your strange demand
To 'collocate' my mind
Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll have to keep you in your place
I've no defence
I've got to keep my veil on my face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash 
my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

You're fey, Janine
A tripper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
For you're a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown

So stay, Janine
And we can glide along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash
my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

"30","Maid Of Bond Street","David Bowie","1967","http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/maidofbondstreet.html","

This girl is made of lipstick
Powder and paint
Sees the picture of herself
Every magazine on every shelf
This girl is maid of bond street
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs
This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus
Buys the Daily News
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her
This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy she once knew
Doesn't want to know her any more
And this girl is a lonely girl
Everything she wants is hers
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time, to love, all the time 
This boy is made of envy
Jealousy
He doesn't have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films 

Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor

And maids of bond street drive round in chauffered cars
Maids of Bond street picture clothes, eyes of star 
Maids of Bond street shouldn't have worldly cares

Maids of Bond street shouldn't have love affairs

[spoken]
Here is the news
According the latest world population survey
The figures have reached danger point, my god
London 15 million 75 thousand
New York 80 million
Paris 15 million and 30
China 1000 million
Billington-Spa: lots

My studies include suffragy
I formed my own society
To study the power of fecundity
The world will overpopulate
Unless you claim infertility
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah 

[CHORUS]
We are not your friends 
We don't give a damn for what you're saying 
We're here to live our lives
I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel
That they are not infertible
The crops of few, the cattle gun
There's only one way to linger on
So who will buy a drink for me, your 
Messiah

Achtung, achtung, these are your orders
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their 
allotted amount of air
Will be slaughtered and cremated
One only cubic foot of air is :
I have prepared a document, legalising mass abortion
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide 

[CHORUS]
You don't seem to hear me clear
Do I talk about your sphere?
Let me explain my project dear
Show you how I'll save the world
Or let it die within the year
Why do you look that way at me, your messiah

We are hungry men
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to eat you

Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red
Rich men's children running past
Their fathers dressed in hose
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes
Gazing eyes and running wild
Past the stocks and over stiles
Kiss the window merry child
But come and buy my toys
You've watched your father plough the field with a ram's horn
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threshed it with a quill
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys
Leave the parsley on the stalls
Come and buy my toys
You shall own a cambric shirt
You shall work your father's land 
But now you shall play in the market square
Till you'll be a man
Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red

War made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier
Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade

Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier
Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless, lonely days
Then one day, in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longinly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier
Sunshine entered our Frankie's days

Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his life was full of joy
Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coins he made
Then two gentlemen called him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game?
Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said ""no more"" to 
The little bombardier
Packed his bags, his heart in pain
Wiped a tear, caught a train
Not to be seen in the town again

The hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean
So rest your head and 
read a treasured dream
I care for no one else but you
I tear my soul to cease the pain
I think maybe you feel the same
What can we do?
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you

They say your life is going very well
They say you sparkle like a different girl
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired
You cry a little in the dark
Well so do I
I'm not quite sure 
what you're supposed to say
But I can see it's not okay

He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine
And when he's strong
He's strong for you
And when you kiss
It's something new
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake?
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do
So I'll just write some love to you

A million dead-end streets
And every time I thought I'd got it made

Of how the others must see the faker

But I can't trace time

I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

When all the world was very young
And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with superfear their tragic endless lives

Could heave nor sigh
In solemn, perverse serenity, wondrous beings chained to life

Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a supergod cries

Where all were minds in uni-thought
Power weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers

Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die
To turn to mold.

Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod cries 

Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod dies

"40","Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud","Space Oddity","1969","http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/wildeyedboyfromfreecloud.html","

Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope
Into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh ""It's the madness in his eyes""
As he breaks the night to cry:

""It's really Me
Really You
And really Me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really You
And really Me
You'll lose me though I'm always 
really free""

And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild Eyed Boy
from Freecloud

And the village Dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the Wild Eyed Boy 
from Freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand

And the Magic in the stare
Of the Wild Eyed Boy said
""Stop, Freecloud 
They won't think to cut me down""
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the Wise Boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain
Track.

In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand

My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long

And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes

Dear Rubber band, you're playing my tunes out of tune, oh

Rubber band, Won't you play a haunting theme again to me

While I eat my scones and drink my cup 
of tea

The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon
Oh, play that theme

How I wish that I could join your Rubber band
We could play in lively parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon I'd find my love

they wore the clothes
They said the things
to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie
like they hope it was
And the Goodmen of Tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of Brawn
were nicer shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep
to our latent fuss
Sighing, the swirl through the streets
Like the crust of the sun
The Bewlay Brothers
In our Wings that Bark
Flashing teeth of Brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, And we were Gone
Hanging out with your Dwarf Men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions

I was Stone and he was Wax
So he could scream,
and still relax, unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old
and dust would flow
Thru our veins and Lo!
it was midnight
Back o' the kitchen door
Like the grim face
on the Cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote
Cannot be found today

And it was Stalking time
for the Moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
In the Devil-may-be-here

The Factor Max that proved the fact
Is melted down

The Bewlay Brothers

In the Crutch-hungry Dark
Was where we flayed our Mark

Kings of Oblivion
We were so Turned On
In the Mind-Warp Pavilion

Lay me place and bake me Pie

Leave my shoes, and door unlocked

And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter

Words of strength and care 
and sympathy
I opened doors
that would have blocked Their way
I braved Their cause to guide, 
for little pay

I ravaged at my finance just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility 
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me""

will blast the sky

Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage

Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt

Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor
on slogans such as

'Wish You Could Hear'
'Love Is All We Need'
'Kick Out The Jams'
'Kick Out Your Mother'
'Cut Up Your Friend'
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'

And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above
And We Can Force You to Be Free
And We Can Force You to Believe""

And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
""I believe in the Power of Good
I Believe in the State of Love
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right""

And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
on the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore 
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich

And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to Believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow

And I Want to Believe
And You Want to Believe
And We Want to Believe
And We Want to Live
Oh, We Want to Live

We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live

I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live

I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live

Live

"47","Soul Love","The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars","1972","http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/soullove.html","

Stone love - she kneels before the grave
A brave son - who gave his life 
to save the slogans
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving

New love - a boy and girl are talking
New words - that only they can share in
New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts

To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning

[CHORUS]
Love is careless in its choosing 
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenceless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving

Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love - and how my God on high is
All love - though reaching up my loneliness 
evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him

Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your 
cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Ohhh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it

And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived 
too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suciide

Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road

But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural - religiously unkind

Oh no love! you're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up but if I could only make you care
Oh no love! you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone 

Just turn on with me and you're not alone 
Let's turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone
Gimme your hands cause you're wonderful [x2]
Oh gimme your hands.

Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall

Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he's fast asleep

When he wakes up on the sea
Be sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint

What a jolly boring thing to do

There is a happy land where only children live
They don't have the time to learn the ways Of you sir, Mr. Grownup 
There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there Mr. Grownup,
Go away sir
Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite

Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us

Mother calls, but we don't hear
There's lots more things to do 
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet
But we will be, very shortly
Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry

Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky

Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away

Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray

There is a happy land where only children live
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup 
Go away sir
Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dup

Strikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop 
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up 
Climbs across his bike and he's away 
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street 
Back to mother, it's another empty day

Uncle Arthur likes his mommy 
Uncle Arthur still reads comics 
Uncle Arthur follows Batman 

Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum 
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed 
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion 
Sally was the real thing, not just lust 

[CHORUS]
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly 
Uncle Arthur and his new bride 
Uncle Arthur follows Sally 
Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze 

Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled 
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop 

He gets his pocket money, he's well fed 
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks 
Uncle Arthur past the river 
Uncle Arthur down the high street

Wake up you sleepy head 
Put on some clothes,
shake up your bed 
Put another log on the fire for me

Look out my window and what do I see 
A crack in the sky 
and a hand reaching down to me

And it looks as though they're
here to stay 
What are we coming to 
No room for me,
no fun for you

Where the books were found

Written in pain, written in awe 
By a puzzled man who questioned 
What we were here for

Spy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to, you won't be the first or last

It must strain you to look down so far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you
I'm the Cream
Of the Great Utopia Dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths 
of your banker's spleen

I'm a phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain
I keep having this brainstorm 
About twelve times a day
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me, quite amazed
As I'm Unwashed 
and Somewhat Slightly Dazed

I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you could spend the morning talking with me quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad and Somewhat Slightly Dazed

Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching
So now, you should spend the mornings lying to your father quite amazed
About the strange Unwashed and Happily Slightly Dazed.

I've loved. All I've needed: love.

Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh, no, not again

I'm stuck with a valuable friend
""I'm happy. Hope you're happy, too.""
One flash of light
But no smoking pistol

I never done good things
I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue,
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now

strength in your stride
And hope in those squeaky clean eyes
You'll get chilly receptions

Blinded with desire

And you push , still you push,

so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten

Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep

Dreaming of tramlines, factories, pieces of machinery
Mine shafts, things like that
March of flowers - March of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil
breaking parole
Ricochet - It's not the end of the world
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil

Teaching life in a violent new way

These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Early, before the sun,
they struggle off to the gates
In their secret fearful places 
they see their lives
Unravelling before them
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil
breaking parole
Ricochet

But when they get home, 
damp eyed and weary
They smile and crush their children to their heaving chests
Making unfulfillable promises
For who can bear to be forgotten

In the event
that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion

And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose
It's a very modern world,
but nobody's perfect

It's a moving world, 
but that's no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It won't be forgotten
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again, will we?

And the wrong words make you listen
In this criminal world
Remember it's true, loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by I suppose
But any sudden movement I've got to write it down
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write it down
And it won't be forgotten

Gotta get a word through one of these days

Getting in mood for a Mombassa night flight
Pushing my luck, gonna fly like a mad thing
Bare strip takeoff
skimming over Rhino

Born in slumber less than peace
Struggle with a child 
whose screaming dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine

Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life
Quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one
Left unnamed

Seemed like another day

Over the bushland over the trees
Wise like Orangutan that was me

Rockets shooting up into space
Buildings they rise to the skies

Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang reach for the sky

I keep a good friend on videotape
He'll drive his sports car
until it's too late
But we'll have a hot time on the town tonight
Cause love is my bet and it's the best yet

Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang sun don't shine
Bang Bang you all angels
Bang Bang now you all ought to be in pictures

Oh girl
Oh girl my problems 
can't follow me
Phone calls I take my machine
I wander lonely to the sea
Lonely-Ha Ha-what does it mean

Bang Bang I got mine
Bang Bang and you are next in line
Bang Bang reach for the sky
Bang Bang sun don't shine

Rise buildings
Rise to the sky
Young girls they know what they're after
I said, young girls don't kiss me goodbye

Do you see that thing
I'm sure it's love
Would you do one thing
New York's in love
The city grew wings 
in the back of the night
The clouds are stuck
like candy-floss
She sees the rich trash 
having all the fun
Makes her wonder where they get the energy from

There's nothing you can do to her
This city's all clean and waiting
I don't mean to wait too long
But this joint can't get much higher

[CHORUS]
New York's in love-
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New York's in flames
New York's in love
With the way she talks
And the way she walks
New York's in love
Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo

My, oh my, it's a tom-tom beat
No-one knows they've had their day
We can dance and we can see the singles swing
Everybody's waiting for the Go-Go Boys.
You're turned to stone by the family
It's now the dead speak to the living
Nothing left here 
but a raging blaze
I don't mean to wait too long

It's just a one dollar secret
A lover's secrets in the UK
Torn apart in the UK
In the dribble of May-Day
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
And there's nothing inside
And there's nothing in mind
And only you
Rocket on thru the sky
It couldn't be done 
without dogs
It couldn't be once 
without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry

When the days were the days were the days boys
When blue ties 
were for the biggy guys
Frannie dressing down for the enemy
You saw him hangin' on the enemy
And there's no one in love
And there's nowhere to scream
And only you
Race on to wonder where
It couldn't be done without dogs
It couldn't be once without us
'87 and Cry
'87 and Cry
You can't make love with money
You can't make mistakes with babies
Nothing looked good on you
That's how I liked you best
Now you're ready for the real McCoy

Deep in the heart of Cupid
Murders on the heels of love
Just the ghost of a story
Just a one dollar secret
Baby these were the sounds
Baby these were the sounds
And only you
Whisper these things aren't true
It couldn't be done with dogs
It couldn't be once without us

Don't look down
They're making sorta crazy sounds
Don't look down, no
Don't know who else came to kneel
On this empty battlefield
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy 
Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name
He never looked down
'Cause they were making crazy sounds
From Central Park to shanty town
He always heard that crazy sound
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

When I see you standing there
I can't see the clothes you wear
I just hear that crazy sound
And I can't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I've always heard that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
Don't look down
Don't look, don't look down

No I won't be bored I won't be there
Look at life it's no piece of cake
When I hear that crazy sound
I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town

Don't look down

Well, don't look,

The moving has come through
The danger passing you
Turns its face into the heat and runs the tunnels

The dark dug up by dogs
The stiches torn and broke
The raw meat fist you choke 
Has hit the bloodlite

Glass traps open and close on 
nite flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to fall

I've seen the city
I took the next flight
For Borneo
They say it's pretty
I like the tee shirts
In Borneo
Some wear Bob Marley
Others in Playboy
Or Duvalier
Make the last plane come
Let me rise through the cloudy above
With a book on Borneo

Strangers come and go
It's such a waste of time
Problems far behind
Another day
But even in springtime
It's a rich slice of life
So send me a letter
I'll reply with a broken spear
That dusky mulatto
In nylons and tattoos
Hot juice in coke bottles
We dance in the sand
Well, they twirl and they tumble

Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble
I've been to Leon's
He's got nine daughters
And a stereo
They say that Leon
Watches from the tree tops
In Borneo
When the road is mud
Everything stops with a thud
That's the way it goes down
yonder in Borneo
Far beneath his mansion
There's an open drain
Sending all the sewage down the hill
But when the general shows movies
No one hesitates
To sneak from the jungle
They laugh and they mumble
Enjoying the show
And that dusky mulatto

Hot juice in coke bottles
In Blue Jeans and tattoos
Well, they twirl and they tumble
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble

I like the free world
They say it's pretty
This time of year
They tumble and twirl [x2]
I'll tumble and twirl

They twirl and they tumble [x2]

I like the free world [x2]

I've never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot and he
He made him fly thru a hole
Till he grew real old
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst

Time will crawl 
Till our mouths 
run dry
Time will crawl 
Till our feet
grow small
Time will crawl 
Till our tails
fall off
Time will crawl
till the 21st century lose

I saw a black black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear

Time will crawl, time will crawl
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask came off
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep

Time will crawl 
and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl 
and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl 
and the streets run red
Time will crawl 
till the 21st century lose

Time will crawl 
and our mouths run dry
Time will crawl 
and our feet grow small
Time will crawl

Time will crawl 
till the 21st century lose

Time will crawl 
and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl

Time will crawl

Time will crawl

We'll give every life
For the crackpot notion

Too exchanging
You've been around

Where the flesh meets the spirit world
Where the traffic is thin
I slip from a vacant view

And the sound of tomorrow
Like a black-hearted vile thing
Like the silence of tension

Now seem so thin and frail
Slinky secrets
Hotter than the sun

No peachy prayers
No trendy rechauffé
I'm with you
So I can't go on

All my violence
Raining tears upon the sheet
I'm bewildered
For we're strangers when we meet

Blank screen TV
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you

Blended sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes

All my violence
Raining tears upon the sheet
I'm resentful
For we're strangers when we meet

Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new

Your embrace
Was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu

Steely resolve
Is falling from me
My poor soul
All bruised passivity

All your regrets
Ride rough-shod over me
I'm so glad
That we're strangers when we meet

I'm so thankful
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover
For we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over

Breathing in only doubt

The pain must feel like snow

Cover me, cover me
We flew on the wings
We were deep in the dead air
And this one will never go down

We had such
wishful beginnings

unbearable lives

So so sorry little girl

Watching them come and go
The Templars and the Saracens
They're travelling the holy land
Opening telegrams

Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of Coeur de Leon
Salvation for the mirror blind

But if you pray 
all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide
the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things,
loving the alien)

And your prayers they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

You pray til the break of dawn
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

And you'll believe you're loving the alien
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan

Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nail

When I was falling to pieces 
I screamed in pain

Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real 
swept over me
You danced your little dance 
'till it made me cry
You were shakin' like this honey doing that

Never let me down She never let me down
Never let me down She never let me down

When you've got nothing coming Call my name

I saw my baby
She was turning blue
I knew that soon
Her young life was through
And so I got down on my knees
Down by her bed
And these are the words
To her I said

Everything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight

I am gonna love you till the end
I will love you till I reach the end
I will love you till I die
I will see you in the sky
Tonight

Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
Oh Lucy look what you're doing I'm doing it too
Now you're looking for God in exciting new ways
I say trust Him at once which is something these days

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she 
knows what the noise 
can do [x2]

Did the world just explode?
Don't recognize anyone
But you've still got me under your thumb

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise 
can do

Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy
In this sexual noise, vicious chords 
offer joy
You live and you die in the blink of an eye
Well I can't make you dance 
Dance to the noise

Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
[x2]
Dance to the noise

Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
But you can't buy me off in this serial world
Who who who died and made you material girl?
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she 
knows what the noise 
can do

So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric
goes wrong
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern
song
Lucy can't dance to the noise but 
she knows what the noise 
can do

Or this shallow orb mugged by reality
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need
you
Live and you die in the blink of an eye
Still I can't make you dance
Dance to the noise

Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do

Photograph king, watches you go
Fashions may change, heaven knows,
but you still leave a stain on me
Supplement queen, 
your colours may fade
Seasons may change, weather blows, but you still leave a
mark on me

Wrong-negative fades-never the twain, reckless and tame

I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look thru your things
I'd like to beat on your drum

I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum

Disco brat-follow the pack
Watching you peel, heaven knows, prison can't hold all 
this greedy intention

Vanity's child-picture you now
Music may change-hi-di-ho keen to follow your nose

Wrong-love out of tune
Sweet is the night,
bright light destroys me

[CHORUS]
I like the beat of your drum
I like to look in your eyes
I like to look thru your things
I'd like to beat on your drum

I like the smell of your flesh
I like the dirt that you dish
I like the clothes that you wear
I'd like to beat on your drum

I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to beat on your drum
I like your face in the crowd
I'd like to beat on your drum

I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to beat on your drum
I'd like to blow on your horn
I'd like to beat on your drum

If you should ever leave me
My life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what I'd be without you

stars above you
You'll never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it
God only knows what I'd be without you

Getting my facts from a Benetton ad 
I'm lookin' thru African eyes
Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire
I've got a face, not just my race, Bang 
Bang I've got you babe
Sun comes up and the man goes down 
And the woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear
Then we jump thru hoops, we're
divisible now, just disappear
We reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Then die in the flames singing ""we
shall overcome""
Whoa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it 
But we'll come thru don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know
you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I look into your eyes
And I wonder sometimes

Oh Lord, just let him see me 
Lord, Lord just let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together.

Reach over race and hold each
other's hands
Walk thru the nite thinking we are the world
Woa! What's going on?
There'll be some blood no doubt about it 
But we'll come thru don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I wonder why
Yes, and I wonder why sometimes 

They'll show us how to break the rules 
But never how to make the rules
Reduce us down to witless punks
Facist cries both black and 
white, who's got the blood, 
who's got the gun.

Putting on the black tie, cranking 
out the white noise
(Just a fool!)

All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives

Cold winter bleeds

This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron

This goddamned starving life

"132","Glass Spider","Never Let Me Down","1987","http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/glassspider.html","

Up until one century ago there lived,
In the Zi Duang province of eastern country
A glass-like spider
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons 
over its web
In weeks creating a macabre
Shrine of remains
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers
Like floors in a building

At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with 
almost apparent
Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops
One could almost call it an altar
When the breeze blew 
thru this construction
It produced sounds of wailing, crying
Tiny wails, tiny cries

The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically for their mother.
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies
Would survive somehow
on their own.
Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a human's.
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries.

Don't you hear this wasted cry, 
Life is over you
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell
(Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now)
Take care, take care.
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)

Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone.
But you, you've promise 
in your lovin' eye. 

God it's dark now.

Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone, Gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 
'cause the water's all gone
Stay low on the ground, fire can drive you,
savage and afraid
Spitting the dawn, come come come along
before the animals awake
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left.
If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might 
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
Mummy come back
'cause the water's all gone

Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 
'cause the water's all gone

I was

In a tunnel

And I've been dreaming in a sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny colored english
We'll creep together you and I
For I know who the small friends are

I am with name, I am with name

A night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name, I am with name

It'll end in chrome
Night of the female 
good time drone
I am with name 
I am Ramona A Stone
She should say: 
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone

A person who loses a name
Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads, between the centuries
A millenium fetish

Night fear female
Good timing drone

Eddie boy lit like paraffin 
spending two weeks
in a crack house
Burns on his brain 
like Chernobyl

Dean was seen 
with a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mother's bed
Someone for pray for-
till I met you

Life is like a broken arrow-
memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune-
I can make you happy
every day of your life
Making my love 
like a shining star
takin' my love just a touch too far

Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice 
cause love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
I've got windows, I've seen much vice, 
I've touched down with vermin,
Cowardice, lice,
And I say

Nobody cares what you do-
please be yourself to death

I could be your great misfortune
But you'll never find a, bet you'll never find a better man.

Making my love 
like a shining star
Taking my love just a touch too far.

Peter met Frank 
formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
Blew heads outta shape for the name of Trotsky, Sinn-
Fein, Hitler cashdown
No hope heroes cover the page 
with debts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs 
threw it all away
Another life in the grave
Another life in the grave

Life is like a broken arrow-
memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune-
Well I could make you happy 
every goddamn single day of your life

Everybody always wants to kiss your trash

You can't help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There's nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighbourhood threat

Somewhere a baby's bleeding
Somewhere a mother's needing
Outside a boy is lying
But mostly he is crying
And he just shouts in anger

I'm gonna say goodbye he says yea
Do not cry she begs of him goodbye yea
All that day she thinks of his love yea

They whip him through the streets and alleys there
The gormless and the baying crowd right there
They can't get enough of that doomsday song
They can't get enough of it all

Listen

Listen to the whores he tells her
He fashions paper sculptures of them
Then drags them to the river‘s bank in the cart
Their soggy paper bodies wash ashore in the dark
And the priest stiff in hate now demanding fun begin
Of his women dressed as men for the pleasure of that priest

Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me
And the next day
And the next
And another day

Ignoring the pain of their particular diseases
They chase him through the alleys chase him down the steps
They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death
And drag him to the feet of the purple headed priest

First they give you everything that you want
Then they take back everything that you have
They live upon their feet and they die upon their knees
They can work with satan while they dress like the saints
They know god exists for the devil told them so
They scream my name aloud down into the well below

Here I am
Not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows
On the gallows for me

And the next

Walking in the snowy street
Let me understand
Drifting down a silent park
Stumbling over land
Open up your heart to me
Show me who you are
And I would be your slave

Do you sleep in quietude?
Do you walk in peace?
Do you laugh out loud at me?
No one else that is free
Open up your heart to me
Show me all you are
And I would be your slave

I don't sit around and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand

I bet you laugh out loud at me
A chance to strike me down
Give me peace of mind at last
Show me all you are
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave

I don't sit and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand
I would give you all my love
Nothing else is free
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave

Steel on the skyline 
Sky made of glass 
Made for a real world 
All things must pass
Oo-o 
Waiting for something 
Looking for someone 
Is there no reason? 
Have I stared too long?

You say you'll leave me
And when the sun is low
And the rays high 
I can see it now 
I can feel it die

Please don't tear this world asunder
Please take back
this fear we're under
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop wanting you

All this pain and all the sorrow
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop needing you
I might just stop needing you
Give my children sunny smile
Give them moon and cloudless sky
I demand a better future

loving you, loving you
When we talk, we talk to you
When we walk, we walk to you
From factory to field
How many tears must fall
Down there below
Nothing is moving

Oogie waits for just another day 
Drags his bones
to see the Yankees play 
Bones Boy talks and flickers gray
Oh, they slip away 

Once a time 
they nearly might have been
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen 
No one knew what they could do 
Except for me and you
They slip away 
They slip away 

Don't forget 
to keep your head warm 
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd 
Watching all the world 
and war torn 
How I wonder where you are 
Oo-o
Sailing over
Coney Island 
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd 
We were dumb 
but you were fun, boy 
How I wonder where you are 
Oo-o

Oogie knew there's never ever time
Some of us will always stay behind
Down in space it's always 1982 
The joke we always knew 
Oo-oo 
What'sa matter with you
C'mon, let's go
Slip away

Here shall we live in this terrible town
Where the price for our minds
shall squeeze them tight like a fist 
And the walls shall have eyes 
And the doors shall have ears
But we'll dance in their dark
And they'll play with our lives 

Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on 
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and round Hark who are we 
So small in times such as these
Slow Burn 
Slow Burn 

Oh, these are the days
These are the strangest of all
These are the nights 
These are the darkest to fall
But who knows?
Echoes in tenement halls
Who knows? 
Though the years spare them all

Like a Slow Burn 
Leading us on and on and on 
Like a Slow Burn 
Twirling us round and round 
and upside down
There's fear overhead 
There's fear overground 
Slow Burn

Like a Slow Burn 
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn 
Turning us round and round and round And here are we
At the center of it all

Where's the morning in my life?
Where's the sense in staying right?
Who said time is on my side?
I've got ears and eyes and nothing in my life 
But I survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

You alone across the floor 
You and me and nothing more
You're the great mistake I never made
I never lied to you, I hated when you lied
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

Beatle boys, all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs every night
Wish I'd sent a Valentine

He swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back 
in Atlantic City
There's not even a demon
in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise
As I walk down the aisle

And I'm gone gone gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall

And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone 
through a crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking

Two young men dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad tempered child 
On a rain slicked street

And I'm gone gone gone
And I'm older than movies
Oh let me dance dance dance

No-one here can see you
Dancing face to face
No-one here can beat you
Dancing out in space

Dancing face to face

Your coat and hat are gone
I really can't look at your little empty shelf
A ragged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Don't look me in the eye

We lay in each others arms
But the room is just an empty space
I guess we lived it out
Something in the air
We smiled too fast 
then can't think of a thing to say

Lived with the best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Nothing left to say

Let's take what we can
I know you hold your head up high
We've raced for the last time
A place of no return

And there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
Something in the air
Something in my eye

Abracadoo - I lose you
We can't avoid the clash
The big mistake
Now we're gona pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Can't believe I'm asking you to go

We used what we could
To get the things we want
But we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I never wanted 
anyone more than you

Lived all our best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you to long
Say what you will

But there's something in the air
Raced for the last time
Well I know you hold your head up high
There's nothing we have to say
There's nothing in my eyes
But there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
There's something I have to say
There's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long

Nothing remains 
We could run 
when the rain slows
Look for the cars or signs of life 
Where the heat goes 
Look for the drifters
We should crawl under the bracken 
Look for the shafts of light on the road
Where the heat goes

Everything has changed 
For in truth, it's the beginning of nothing
And nothing has changed 
Everything has changed
For in truth, it's the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed
And everything has changed

In your fear 
Of what we have become
Take to the fire
Now we must burn 
All that we are 
Rise together
Through these clouds 
As on wings

[2nd voice]
In your fear, seek only peace 
In you fear, seek only love 
In your fear, seek only peace
In you fear, seek only love 
In your fear, in your fear 
As on wings 
This is the trip 
And this is the business we take
This is our number 
All my trials, Lord
Will be remembered
Everything has changed

Said you took a big trip
They said you moved away
Happened oh, so quietly

Shoulda took a picture
Something I could keep
Buy a little frame
Something cheap
For you

Everyone says hi

Said you sailed a big ship
Said you sailed away
Didn't know the right thing
To say

I'd love to get a letter
Like to know what's what
Hope the weather's good
And it's not too hot
For you

Everyone says hi

Don't stay in a sad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says hi

If the money is lousy
You can always come home
We can do the old things
We can do all the bad things
If the food gets you leery
You can always phone
We could do all the good things
We could do it, we could do it,
we could do it
Don't stay in a bad place

There's a graveyard by the station
Where the girls wear nylon skirts and
Sandals from Hungary
The boys ride their Riga 1's
Upon the little hill
Such sadness and grief
The trees die standing

That's where we made our trysts
And struggled with our guns
Would you still love me
If the clocks could go backwards
The girls would fill with blood and
The grass would be green again
Remember the dead
They were so great
Some of them

Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya
How does the grass grow
Blood blood blood
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya
Where do the boys lie
Mud mud mud
How does the grass grow
Blood blood blood

But I lived a blind life
A white face in prison
But you made a life out of nothing
Now I ride my black horse
I miss you more
Than you'll ever ever know
Waiting with my red eyes
And my stone heart

Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya
How does the grass grow
Blood blood blood
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya
Where do the boys lie
Mud mud mud
How does the grass grow
Blood blood blood

I gaze in defeat
At the stars in the night
The light in my life burnt away
There will be no tomorrow
Then you sigh in your sleep
And meaning returns with the day

Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya
Where do the boys lie
Mud mud mud
How does the grass grow
Blood blood blood

Seen them die to get high...

Black eyed ravens
They spiral down
They tilt his head back
To the flame filled sunset
Rise their guns high
As the darken falls
These are the days, boys 

Shallow man
Shallow man 
Eats in the doorways 
With his head inclined
And he's always in decline
No one heals anymore
So he shrinks as they ride
Under vermillion sky

So it goes 
Just a searcher
Lonely soul 
The last of the dreamers

Shallow man
Shallow man
Speaks to the shadows
Moves his trembling hands
And he's always a little late
For the dawning of the day

So it goes 
Just a searcher
Lonely soul 
The last of the dreamers

No-one ever saw you
Moving through the dark
Leaving slips of paper
Somewhere in the park
Hidden from your friends
Stealing all they knew
Lovers thrown in airless rooms
Then vile rewards for you

And I'm gonna tell
Yes I've gotta tell
Gotta tell the things you've said
When you're talking in the dark
And I'm gonna tell the things you've done
When you're walking through the park

Some night on the thriller's street
Will come the silent gun
You've got a dangerous heart
You stole their trust, their moon, their sun
There'll come assassin's needle
On a crowded train
I'll bet you feel so lonely
You could die

Buildings crammed with people
Landscape filled with wrath
Grey concrete city
Rain has wet the street
I want to see you clearly
Before you close the door
A room of bloody history
You made sure of that

I can see you as a corpse
Hanging from a beam
I can read you like a book
I can feel you falling
I hear you moaning in your room
Oh see if i care
Oh please. Please make it soon

Walls have got you cornered
You've got the blues my friend
And people don't like you
But you will leave without a sound, without an end

Oblivion shall own you
Death alone shall love you
I hope you feel so lonely
You could die
You could die
You feel so lonely
You could die

""Are you OK?

The old woman said
So I drink in the shadows
Of an evening sky

The stars look so special
And the snow looks so old
The frail form is drifting
Beyond the orc's zone
Time to question the mountain
Why pigs can fly
It's nothing at all

Nothing ever goes away

And hid among the junk of wretched highs

Nabokov is sun-licked now
Upon the beach at Grunewald
Brilliant and naked just
The way that authors look

Clare and Lady Manners drink
Until the other cows go home
Gossip till their lips are bleeding
Politics and all

I'd rather be high
I'd rather be flying
I'd rather be dead
Or out of my head
Than training these guns on those men in the sand
I'd rather be high

The Thames was black, the tower dark
I flew to Cairo, find my regiment
City's full of generals
And generals full of shit

I stumble to the graveyard and I
Lay down by my parents, whisper
Just remember duckies
Everybody gets got

I'd rather be high
I'd rather be flying
I'd rather be dead
Or out of my head
Than training these guns on those men in the sand
I'd rather be high

I'm seventeen my looks can prove it
I'm so afraid that I will lose it
I'd rather smoke and phone my ex
Be pleading for some teenage sex
Yeah

I'd rather be high
I'd rather be flying
I'd rather be dead
Or out of my head
Than training these guns on the men in the sand

I find you out before you grow old

What is clay and what is sand?

Who to listen to? Who to suss?

From nowhere to nothing
And I go way back

Children swarm like thousands of bugs
Towards the lights the beacons above the hill
The stars to the West, the South, the North
And to the East

Now you could say I've got a gift of sorts
A fear of rear windows and swinging doors
A love of violence a dread of sighs

Swear to destroy the beasts stamping the ground
In their excitement for tomorrow

I could wear your new blue shoes

And walk to the crossroads
So take this knife
And meet me across the river

I will take your lands and all that lays beneath
The dust of cold flowers prison of dark ashes
I will slaughter your kind who descend from belief
I am the spirit of greed a lord of theft

She was sick with fear and cold
She felt too old for all of this

Loves lies like a dead cloud
On a shabby, yellow lawn

For the priceless man
Who suffers gloom
So slow
Eyes were stolen
For her
A sleeping sky
Takes the moon
So slow
I would slide away

Further out to sea
Further out to sea
So she

She saw me smile
Feeling like
I'd never been
She saw me smile
Feeling like I'd never been
In love
Feeling like I'd never been
The only one and all alone

The only one and all alone

You promised me the ending would be clear
You'd let me know when the time was now
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Stab me in the dark, let me disappear

Memories that flutter like bats out of hell
Stab you from the city spires
Life wasn't worth the balance
Or the crumpled paper it was written on

Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible

Hot cash days that you trailed around
Cold cold nights under chrome and glass
Led me down river of perfumed limbs
Sent me to the streets with the good time girls

Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible
We could dance, dance, dance thru' the fire
Dance, dance, dance thru' the fire

Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the disco king
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king

Spin-offs with those who slept like corpses
Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs
Killing time in the '70s
Smelling of love through the moist winds
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Close me in the dark, let me disappear
Soon there'll be nothing left of me
Nothing left to release

Dance, dance, dance thru' the fire
Dance, dance, dance thru' the fire
Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the disco king
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king

Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

We live closer to the earth
Never to the heavens
The stars are never far away
Stars are out tonight

They watch us from behind their shades
Brigitte, Jack and Kate and Brad
From behind their tinted window stretch
Gleaming like blackened sunshine

Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

Waiting for the first move
Satyrs and their child wives
Waiting for the last move
Soaking up our primitive world

Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

Their jealousy's spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever

And they know just what we do
That we toss and turn at night
They're waiting to make their moves
But the stars are out tonight

Here they are upon the stairs
Sexless and unaroused
They are the stars, they're dying for you
But I hope they live forever

They burn you with their radiant smiles
Trap you with their beautiful eyes
They're broke and shamed or drunk or scared
But I hope they live forever

Their jealousy's spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever

And they know just what we do
That we toss and turn at night
They're waiting to make their moves on us
The stars are out tonight

The stars are out tonight
The stars are out tonight

I took a trip
on a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you 
I passed through the shadow of Jupiter
And I thought about you 
I shot my spacegun
And boy, I really felt blue

Two or three flying saucers 
Parked under the stars 
The winding stream
Moon shining down 
On some little town
And with each beam 
The same old dream

I took a trip 
on a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I pulled down my sun visor
Boy, I really felt blue 

You jumped into your Gemini
I jumped into mine 
We'll orbit the moon
For just one time
Tomorrow night 
Tomorrow night 
Will you hold hands 
With me in the moonlight

I took a trip
in a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you 
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you 
I took
I took a walk in space 
Boy, I really felt blue 

Well, I peeked through the crack
And I looked way back 
The stardust trail 
Leading back to you
What did I do 
What could I do 
Yes what did I do 

Well
I thought about you
I thought about you
Took a trip
on a gemini spacecraft
Thought about you

For your grave

Why too dark to speak the words?
For I know that you have a son
Oh, folly, Sue

Ride the train I’m far from home
In a season of crime none need atone

Endless faith in hopeless deeds
I kissed your face

As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy

The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building

And red, mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City
No more big wheels

Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
Coverting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers

Her hearts have been broken just like you

[CHORUS (YOU)]
All night
You want the young American
Young American, young American, you want the young American
All right
You want the young American

You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man who can say no more? 
And, ain't there a woman I can 
sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me
break down and cry?

[CHORUS (I) (repeat 3 times ad lib)]
All night
I want the young American
Young American, young American, I want the young American
All right
I want the young American

I'll make you a deal, like any other candidate

We'll pretend we're walking home 'cause your future's at stake
My set is amazing, it even smells like a
street
There's a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall ""I smell the blood of les tricoteuses""
Who wrote up scandals in other bars

I'm having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumours and lies and stories they made up

Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you'd never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner that's selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces, Charlie Manson, Cassius Clay
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
So you scream out of line
""I want you! I need you! Anyone out there?
Any time?""
Tres butch little number whines ""Hey dirty, I want you
When it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad I go to pieces""
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing

Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar like a church with the door ajar
Well, I guess we've must be looking for a different kind

But we can't stop trying 'til we break up our minds
Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright

I guess we could cruise down one more time

With you by my side, it should be fine

We'll buy some drugs and watch a band

Then jump in the river holding hands

Time - He's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me boys

Time - He flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy

Time - In Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time

The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, 
and many other last names
I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think 
""Oh God I'm still alive""

We should be on by now [x2]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la [repeat]

You - are not a victim
You - just scream with boredom
You - are not evicting time

Chimes - Goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time

Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, 
I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you 
dreamless
The door to dreams was closed. 
Your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, 
smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was the guilt for dreaming

We should be on by now [x5]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la [repeat]

Yeah, time!

He looked a lot like Che Guevara, 
drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion,
such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit

He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening 
gloom
The police had warned of repercussions

They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit

Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
And I found my teacher
crouching in his overalls

I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights

Having scored a trillion dollars, 
made a run back home

Found him slumped across the table. 
A gun and me alone
I ran to the window. Looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit. 
He'd left me an autograph
""Let me collect dust."" 
I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit

It's safe in the city, to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screens from the door
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger?

So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the centre of things
Where the knowing one says

Boys, boys, its a sweet thing
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing

Makes me feel important and free

If his trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads, and hamburgers, and...

No one else I'd rather be

just for a short while

and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair 
for making up underwear

A Benny Goodman 1fan painted holes in his hands

with the reason why

Come see, come see, remember me?

We played out an all night movie role

You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled

In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore)
(Mor-or-or-or-ore)

I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side

I'm looking for the treason that I knew in '65

Beware the savage jaw 
Of 1984

[CHORUS]

I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had

I'm stiff on my legend, 
the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty 
cause you just got paid

[CHORUS]
Crack, baby, crack, 
show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck,
give me your head
Before you start professing 
that you're knocking me dead

You caught yourself a trick down 
on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby
you're a porcupine

You sold me illusions for a sack full of cheques
You've made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex

New feeling inside
It's a hot certain kind
I feel hot and cold
Down in my soul, baby

I can't explain
Going out of my mind
Dizzy in the head, and I'm feeling blue
Things you say well maybe they're true
I get funny dreams again and again
Knows what it means, but

Can't explain
I think it's love
Say it to you
When I feel blue

I can't explain, no, I can't explain

You know I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind
Well I'm a worried guy
But I can't explain

Cold fire, you've got everything 
but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place near you

So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tired
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart in pieces

[CHORUS]
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The Prettiest Star

One day though it might 
as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The Prettiest Star

[CHORUS]

One day though it might
as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The Prettiest Star

[Written by John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
[Originally performed by The Beatles in the album ""Let It Be""]

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup 
They slither wildly as they slip away
Across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[CHORUS (twice)]
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light which dance before me like a 
Million eyes
They call me on and on 
Across the universe
Thoughts meander like the restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe

[CHORUS 1 (twice)]

Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my 
open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on and on
Across the universe

"246","Diamond Dogs","Diamond Dogs","1974","http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/diamonddogs.html","

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party

With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Todd Browning's freak you was

Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will,
mannequins with kill appeal

[CHORUS]
(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone.

Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase

The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzie, go man go

Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake

Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are sableized

[CHORUS]

In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the Ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow

[CHORUS]

Ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs [x2]
Bow-wow, woof woof, bow-wow, wow
Call them the Diamond Dogs [ad lib]

Keep cool - Diamond Dogs rule, OK
Beware of the Diamond Dogs [repeat]

In my life I've never stopped 
to worry about a thing
Opened up and shouted out 
and never tried to see
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long

[CHORUS]
Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone

Once we had an easy ride 
and always felt the same
Time was on our side 
and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days

Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And Mummy didn't need no boys

[CHORUS]

Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
Get your feet back on the ground

"248","We Are The Dead","Diamond Dogs","1974","http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davidbowie/wearethedead.html","

Something kind of hit me today
I looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way

People will hold us to blame
It hit me today, it hit me today

We're taking it hard all the time
Why don't we pass it by?
Just reply, you've changed your mind
We're fighting with the eyes of the blind
Taking it hard, taking it hard

Yet now
We feel that we are papers, choking on you nightly
They tell me ""Son, we want you, be elusive, but don't walk far""
For we're breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin
For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy
You're just an ally of the leecher
Locator for the virgin King, but I love you in your fuck-me pumps
And your nimble dress that trails
Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead

One thing kind of touched me today

I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
Pressing our love through the night

Knowing it's right, knowing it's right

Now I'm hoping some one will care
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared

Trusting on the sons of our love
That someone will care, someone will care

But now
We're today's scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow's double feature
Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell
It's a twenty-four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell

And the streets are full of press men
Bent on getting hung and buried
And the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt
Who sucks you while you're sleeping
It's the theater of financiers
Count them, fifty 'round a table
White and dressed to kill

Oh caress yourself, my juicy
For my hands have all but withered
Oh dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said

We are the dead
We are the dead
We are the dead

Got to use her

Out of my head and my mouth's getting dry

You need some guiding baby

She'll come, she'll go.
She'll lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky oil
The lady from another grinning soul

Cologne she'll wear. Silver and Americard
She'll drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta

And when the clothes are strewn
don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast. 
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end

She'll come, she'll go.
She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become 
her point of view

And when the clothes are strewn 
don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast. 
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end [repeat]

He's everybody's token, on everybody's wall
Blessing all the papers, thanking one and all
Hugging all the babies, kissing all the ladies
Knowing all that you think about from writing on the wall
He's so divine, his soul shines
Breaks the night, sleep tight
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race
He says ""I'm somebody""
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart

He says ""Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me""
He's the savage son of the TV tube
Planets wrote the day was due
All the wisest men around
Predicted that a man was found
Who looked a lot like you and me, yeah
Everyone with sense could see
Nothing left his eye unmoved, he
Had the plan, he had to use
He's so divine, his soul shines
Breaks the night, sleep tight
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race

He says ""I'm somebody""
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart

He says ""Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me""
Somebody plays my song in tune
Makes me, makes me, makes me stronger for you, babe
Was a way when we were young, that
Any man was judged by what he'd done
But now you pick them on the screen (what they look like) 
Where they've been

[CHORUS 2]
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart

He says ""Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me""
Leaders come, they hate all the people know
That given time, the leaders go
Tell me, can they hold you under their spell
Can they walk and hold you as well as a
Smile like Valentino?
Could he sell you anything?
Keep your eyes on your soul, keep your hand on your heart

He says ""Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me""
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody
Yeah, can't remember (somebody) peace so well

Oh, space to ramble, (somebody, somebody) space to boogie

Soul shine (Ooh-ooh)
So divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh, somebody)
Soul shine (Ooh-ooh)
So divine
Somebody (ooh-ooh)
Somebody, somebody, somebody

Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo

Everybody's raised in blindness
Everybody knows it's true

Nobody can break their bondage

Putting on a face that's new
Someone has to see, a role for him and me
Someone might as well be you

Up in heaven, any angel
Writes a special game to play
Oh-oh, could we, could we make a star to snatch their angels, boy
Played your role for every day
